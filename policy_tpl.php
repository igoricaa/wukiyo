		Overview
	</p>
	<p>
		From time to time, W-YO® may offer products for purchase through the Service (“Products”). <br>
		We reserve the right to refuse any order you place with us. We may, in our sole discretion, limit or cancel
		quantities or Products purchased per person,
		per household or per order.
	</p>
	<p>
		These restrictions may include orders placed by or under the same account, the same credit card, and/or orders
		that use the same billing and/or shipping address. In the event that we make a change to or cancel an order, we
		may attempt to notify you by contacting the email, billing address and/or phone number provided at the time the
		order was made.</p>
	<p>We reserve the right to limit or prohibit orders that, in our sole judgment, <br>
		appear to be placed by dealers, <br>
		resellers or distributors.</p>
	<p class="fontBold">Age</p>
	<p>
		You must be 18 years of age or <br>
		older to purchase any Products <br>
		from W-YO®.</p>
	<p class="fontBold">Pricing</p>
	<p>Prices for Products are subject to change without notice. All prices for Products are in Euro or US dollars, <br>
		and are exclusive of any applicable local, state, or federal taxes. Shipping and handling fees, if any, will be
		reviewable prior to submitting your order.</p>
	<p class="fontBold">Payment</p>
	<p>Payment All payments through the Service are processed using a third-party processor. You acknowledge that W-YO®
		is not liable for any breaches of credit card or debit card security or privacy by such third-party processor.
		You agree to pay all charges incurred by users of your credit card, debit card, or other method of payment.</p>
	<p class="fontBold">Shipping</p>
	<p>W-YO® will ship all Products purchased through the Service to the address specified in the shipping address
		section of the order form.</p>
	<p>
		Once your order is placed, you will receive an Order Email Confirmation. <br>
		You will then receive a follow up email with the tracking number once the <br>
		order ships, so that you can track its whereabouts as the expected delivery date approaches.
	</p>
	<p>
		Orders typically process through <br>
		the fulfillment center and ship within <br>
		24 - 48 hours of the corresponding business day.
	</p>
	<p>Estimated time of arrival depends <br>
		on which shipping option you select during checkout.</p>
	<p>Shipments will be made via standard ground service unless otherwise specified at the time of purchase. <br>
		The time period from order to delivery will vary depending on location.</p>
	<p class="fontBold">Refunds and replacements</p>

		recent order,

		by the laws of the state or laws of the country in which you live.</p>
	<p>If the product you received expires within 2 months, was damaged in transit, or is otherwise defective, we will
		replace it with a similar version of the product at no cost to you. If the product doesn’t agree with you we
		will (at our discretion) refund your order. Refund policy subject to change without notice.</p>
