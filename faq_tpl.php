                           <p>The objective of the invention is to expand the arsenal of tools that improve microvascularization in brain tissue. The problem is solved by the use of W-sensei and W-komorai as a means of improving microvascularization in brain tissue. W-sensei has neuroprotective, atioxidant cardioprotective and antihypoxic activity, as well as antiarrhythmic, antiplatelet, antithrombotic and antithrombogenic properties. The use of W-sensei as a means of improving microvascularization in brain tissue is not described in the literature. Fundamentally new in the present invention is that as a means of improving microvascularization in brain tissue, W-sensei is used. This type of activity of W-sensei does not explicitly follow from the prior art. W-sensei can be used in the complex therapy of pathologies accompanied by impaired microvascularization in brain tissue in cases of cerebrovascular accident. Thus, this technical solution meets the criteria of the invention: "novelty", "inventive step", "industrial applicability".</p>

                           <p>Both formulations are designed to deliver similar benefits, but each does provide so in its unique way.</p>
                           <p>Both WUKIYO® | apex and WUKIYO® | esse are potent stimulants and contain the same trademarked nootropic formulations by W-YO®, W-sensei™ and W-komorai™, along with two patented chemicals CRL-21X™ and FL66™.</p>
                           <p>One of the key distinctions you'll notice between WUKIYO® | apex and WUKIYO® | esse is in the ingredient choice, mechanism of action, and effectiveness.</p>
                           <p>In addition to the similarities mentioned above, WUKIYO® | esse uses several other clinically studied ingredients to aid cognitive enhancement and focuses on cognitive function in its entirety. Its all-inclusive formula compresses all the benefits of cognitive function, performance, productivity, neurogenesis, and long-term mental well-being.</p>
                           <p>Unlike WUKIYO® | esse, which is geared towards complete and balanced cognitive enhancement, WUKIYO® | apex is designed specifically to highlight those effects with the only one tablet and through monthly supply product packaging, making you truly limitless.</p>

                           <p>There are many reasons why W-YO® offers the best CBD oil on the market right now. The most important reason of all is that we ensure the highest quality across all steps of production. First, we make sure that our hemp is grown without the use of any harmful toxins, such as chemical fertilizers or pesticides. Then we use only the latest CO2 extraction equipment to retrieve all of the beneficial cannabinoids (not just CBD, but CBN, CBG, and CBC as well) for our products. Finally, we make certain that every batch is lab tested by a trustworthy and accredited independent third party.</p>

                        <div class="hidden">
                           <p>The normal human physiological system contains a unique self-regulating system known as the endocannabinoid system, which is responsible for regulating and controlling some of the major aspects of the human physiological system. </p>
                           <p>Some of these aspects include sleep, pain, immune response, etc. The body produces compounds called endocannabinoids, which actually hold on to the receptors in the nervous system. This mechanism can be manipulated therapeutically.</p>
                           <p>This therapeutic manipulation can be performed with the help of WUKIYO® | pure 3000 MG Full-Spectrum CBD oil. </p>
                           <p>WUKIYO® | pure CBD oil is a potent cannabinoid and it is a major element of the endocannabinoid system too. The oil can bind with the receptors in your body and help in the suppression of pain. One of the main WUKIYO® | pure CBD oil effects is the alleviation of chronic pain. </p>
                           <p>WUKIYO® | pure CBD oil directly impacts endocannabinoid activity and can be used as a very useful and long-term analgesic. It can be used to combat inflammation as well.</p>

                           <p>Recommended daily dose and suggested use: </p>
                           <p>For best results, take one full dropper [1 ml] up to two times daily. Shake well before using. Place the dropper under your tongue, squeeze, and let the CBD oil sit for 20-30 seconds before swallowing.</p>
                           <p>Please be responsible and do not exceed recommended daily dosage.</p>

                           <p><u>The most common dose of WUKIYO® | pure CBD oil</u></p>
                           <p>The most common dose of CBD oil is 30 mg - 60 mg per dose. Some people take much less [as low as 10 mg], others take much higher [up to 150 mg].</p>
                           <p>The truth is that the optimal dose of CBD oil is different for everybody.</p>
                           <p>It's common for two people with identical weights to respond very differently to the same dose of CBD oil. One person may find the ideal dose for them is 100 mg of CBD, while the other person responds better to just 30 mg.</p>
                           <p>The ideal dose of WUKIYO® | pure CBD oil for you depends on a variety of factors, including:</p>
                           <p>• Your size and weight.</p>
                           <p>• The severity of the condition you're treating.</p>
                           <p>• Your tolerance to CBD oil.</p>
                           <p>• Your individual body chemistry.</p>
                           <p>• The potency of the CBD oil.</p>
                           <p>The best way to find the right dose for your body is to start with a very low dose [30 mg, for example] and increase by 10 mg per dose until you find what works best for you.</p>

                           <p>At the completion of the culturing process under optimized growing environments, the block of mycelial biomass and fruit bodies are shredded and dehydrated with heated, filtered, and UVC-sanitized air. During the initial stage of the dehydration process, the mushroom material is exposed to a steam activation step that increases the bioavailability of nutrients and bioactive compounds. Temperatures during the moisture removal process are monitored to ensure that the finished powders are safe to consume as "ready-to-eat" superfoods. The result is a whole food mushroom with a Full-Spectrum of naturally occurring nutrients.</p>

                        <div class="hidden">
                           <p>WUKIYO® | bliss Pro Nootropic Mushrooms have been traditionally used for thousands of years. Numerous published research articles have established the health benefits of these unique and powerful mushrooms.</p>
                           <p>Support for immune health is the primary benefit. WUKIYO® | bliss Pro Nootropic Mushrooms contain beta glucans which are important for immune system functionality. Humans do not produce beta glucans and, therefore, functional mushrooms can play an important role in supporting daily health and wellness. </p>
                           <p>In addition to immune health, each type, or species of WUKIYO® | bliss Pro Nootropic Mushroom provides its own special benefits including aiding cognitive and neurological health, gut health, cardiovascular health, bone health, healthy blood sugar, liver health, beauty (healthy hair, skin and nails), vitality, sports performance and recovery, and support for the management of occasional stress, both physical and mental.</p>
                           <p>What we do know is that psychedelic substances - Psilocybin act on the serotonin (5-HT) receptors in our brain. Serotonin receptors are found throughout our nervous system and govern many aspects of our being, including mood, thinking, and bowel movements. Psychedelics bind most effectively to the 5HT-2A receptor, which is one of the receptors involved in learning, memory, and cognition. </p>
                           <p>As a result, when consuming only a microdose of a psychedelic substance and thus avoiding the “classical trip,” the brain can focus solely on the cognitive boost caused by these receptors.</p>

                           <p>Recommended daily dose and suggested use: </p>
                           <p>For best results, take 1 capsule every 3rd day, preferably with a light meal or a snack. If more than 1 capsule is consumed, you may experience euphoric sensations. This is normal and will fade away in hours.</p>
                           <p>Microdosing protocol: 1 day on | 2 days off.</p>
                           <p>There's a fixed protocol for making conscious use of all the positive effects of microdosing. It's better to start with a low dose and build up gradually over time as you become more confident. The challenge of microdosing is to find your personal sweet spot dose that let's you enter in to the flow state.</p>
                           <p>While microdosing can act as a catalyst to make you more self-aware, more creative, and more productive; as with any mind-enhancing substance, it should be used consciously and responsibly, in moderation.</p>

                        <div class="hidden">
                           <p>Magic Psilocybin truffles are a class of psychoactive fungi which contain the psychedelic compounds psilocybin and psilocin. You may be familiar with their better known counterpart, 'magic mushrooms' (psilocybin mushroom, psilocybe mushrooms, psilocybe cubensis). In fact, magic Psilocybin truffles are actually the same as magic Psilocybin mushrooms belonging to the same species of psychoactive fungi, just at a different stage of development.</p>
                           <p>Known as sclerotia, psychoactive truffles are simply a dormant form of fungus, which store food reserves in a hardened mycelium, until ready to grow into psychoactive mushrooms. They are essentially the subterranean part of a mushroom.</p>
                           <p>There are several species of truffles containing the psychoactive compounds psilocybin and psilocin. The known species include Psilocybe tampanensis, Psilocybe mexicana, Psilocybe atlantis and Psilocybe galindoii.</p>
                           <p>These transformation substances have been used by many ancient cultures to facilitate healing and spiritual growth, and are used in modern times to treat mental health issues as well as to promote overall well-being.</p>
                           <p>Both Psilocybin mushrooms and Psilocybin truffles can produce a powerful and intense psychedelic effect and a deeply introspective experience.</p>

                        <h4 class="toggleAccordion product-specific-question">Why Psilocybin truffles?</h4>
                        <div class="hidden">
                           <p>The psychoactive ingredient Psilocybin in magic truffles has been named by the FDA as a “breakthrough therapy” for treatment-resistant depression and anxiety. Numerous studies from Johns Hopkins University, Imperial College in London, and Harvard university show the effectiveness of Psilocybin in the treatment of anxiety, depression, PTSD, OCD, and addiction.</p>
                           <p>Users report healing past trauma, overcoming limiting beliefs, and deepening their spirituality, often reporting mystic-like experiences. Benefits typically include an increased sense of joy, purpose, and meaning and feeling connected with oneself, others, and the world.</p>
                           <p>In one clinical trial from Johns Hopkins University, about 80% of healthy participants who experienced a Psilocybin session named it to be among the top 5 of the most personally and spiritually significant of their lives. And about 90% reported increased life satisfaction and positive behavioural change, including increased positive move and better social relationships.</p>
                           <p>In comparison to magic Psilocybin mushrooms, magic Psilocybin truffles are said to produce a less intense, shorter journey, as they contain lower concentration of the active substance psilocybin. That being said, they contain enough to induce a powerful and profound psychedelic experience which should be approached with guidance.</p>
                           <p>The advantage of consuming magic Psilocybin truffles grown by W-YO® in the Netherlands, is that you will be able to attain a reliable and controlled dose of psilocybin as it is a legal market and produced by dedicated manufacturer.</p>

                        <div class="hidden">
                           <p>The magic Psilocybin truffle journey with WUKIYO® | bliss Pro Nootropic Mushrooms Microdose is reported to be very similar to a magic Psilocybin mushrooms journey. Effects typically last 4-6 hours, with the peak coming in at the 2 hour mark.</p>
                           <p>Effects of the psychedelic journey can be intense and include shifts in perception including tactile sensations, heightened emotions, deep insights, and a sense of interconnectedness with the world around. At higher doses you may experience ego-dissolution, mystical experiences and different forms of visual hallucination.</p>
                           <p>Intense emotions are common - both pleasurable and challenging. Colours may become brighter and more intense and shapes may blur, surfaces may look like they are swirling, and you may have a sense that your surroundings are 'breathing'.</p>
                           <p>Your thoughts may become more cohesive, creative and interconnected. Objects and people may change characteristics and take on new significance. You might be drawn to nature and feel especially amazed by its beauty.</p>
                           <p>Deep feelings of gratitude, euphoria, and connection are often felt. You may gain new perspectives, or a bird’s eye view on your own life, behaviours, limitations, and of those around you.</p>

                        <div class="hidden">
                           <p>If you are about to start your microdosing journey, you have to know that the easiest and the only legal way is to do it with our WUKIYO® | bliss Pro Nootropic Mushrooms - Psilocybin truffles Microdose.</p>
                           <p>Psilocybin truffles are completely legal in the Netherlands and can be freely produced, traded, and sold. The product falls under the category of Food Supplements according to European directives and it fully complies with the applicable Safety Standards.</p>
                           <p>The hallucinogenic substances that give Psilocybin truffles their effect are listed in the Psychotropic Substances Convention. Since these substances occur in many fungi - the United Nations has decided to make an exception for these natural products. Psilocybin is excluded from the convention and therefore have legal status.</p>
                           <p>The Dutch National Institute of Health, Office of dietary supplements regulates the safety of food, drugs, and other consumer products. WUKIYO | bliss™ fits the bill.</p>
                           <p>Microdosing Psilocybin truffles is basically the same as microdosing Psilocybin mushrooms. The main differences lie in the legal status of Psilocybin truffles compared to Psilocybin mushrooms and the potency. As previously mentioned, Psilocybin truffles are legal in many countries, whereas Psilocybin mushrooms are not.</p>
                           <p>The movement</p>
                           <p>The United States and Canada are currently witnessing a decriminalization movement for Psilocybin, which began in the late 2010s. So far, decriminalization has been voted for in Colorado, Santa Cruz, California, Denver, and Oakland.</p>
                           <p>The new regulation of the use, production, sale, and possession of natural sources of Psilocybin will go into effect in the next few years.</p>
                           <p>Furthermore, Nepal, Brazil, Jamaica, the Bahamas, and Samoa have listed Psilocybin as a legal substance.</p>

                           <p>While some companies are looking to produce synthetic Psilocybin, others are using the natural active substances in Psilocybin mushrooms and Psilocybin truffles to produce a psychedelic drug that can be used therapeutically and in a microdosing setting.</p>
