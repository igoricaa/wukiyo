== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this Zelle plugin integrate with the Zelle payment APIs? =

This plugin is a quick and easy way to display to your customers your Zelle information.
Unfortunately, this plugin doesn't integrate with your bank or the Zelle app as an end-to-end payment.
It only displays your Zelle information to the customer so that the customer can know how to proceed in their Zelle/bank app.

= What is emailreceipts.io and do I need to integrate it? =

emailreceipts.io is a service that allows you to track Zelle payments and update order statuses automatically.
The integration also helps send automated emails to your customers when their order status changes.
If you do not want to use emailreceipts.io, you will have to manually update the order status in your Woocommerce admin dashboard.
